# Instagram Lumen
Backend services for Instagram (coursework) built using Lumen Framework (PHP) and Unit Testing using phpunit

Instagram is widely used SNS that mainly focused on media sharing including photos and videos. In this coursework, I'm made photos sharing (not yet including the create, update and delete images) backend like Instagram using Lumen. Lumen is a framework built using PHP for backend. Lumen is light, and its suited for API. Since I only make backend on this repo, I use Lumen for simple yet powerful framework. 

TDD is cool things to try, it helps clear goals of development before actually making it. There are some process in TDD, but I mainly used unit testing using phpunit.

### How to run Lumen
